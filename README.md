Direct To Your Door
===================

Provide a simple, mobile-friendly page which gives step by step directions from the user's current location to a pre-defined destination.

The idea here is that small businesses and events have a QR code on their fliers/advertising which, when scanned, will bring 
the user directly to their door from their current location.

It makes use of the javascript geolocation facilities provided in modern browsers as well as Google's directions service.

Setup should be as simple as dropping this folder in to a directory ont eh webserver and updating the destination co-ordinates at the top of index.html.

@TODO: Make configuration simpler via a basic config file
